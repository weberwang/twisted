The following scripts were removed from the bin directory:
 - cftp
 - ckeygen
 - conch
 - mailmail
 - pyhtmlizer
 - tkconch
 - trial
 - twistd

These scripts are now generated by setup.py using the console_scripts
entry point.  During installation, setup.py will install the
generated scripts into the appropriate bin directory.
